How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Understanding user needs and turning them into software is essential. I start by conducting user research through interviews and surveys to learn what they really want. I use user stories—simple descriptions of features from the user's point of view. I embrace Agile methods like Scrum or Kanban to allow for quick updates based on feedback. Being a good team member means I communicate clearly, collaborate well with others, adapt to changes, take responsibility for my work, and support my teammates. By following these steps, I can create software that works well and truly meets user needs.
